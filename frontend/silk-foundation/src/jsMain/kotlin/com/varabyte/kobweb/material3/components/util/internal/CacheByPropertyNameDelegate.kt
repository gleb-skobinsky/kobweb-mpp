/**
 * A property delegate that caches its generated value so the same instance will be returned on subsequent calls when
 * delegated to by the same property over and over again.
 *
 * For example, ComponentStyle here is actually a function which returns a subclass of this caching provider. So when
 * you use it like this:
 *
 * ```
 * val MyStyle by ComponentStyle { /* ... */ }
 * ```
 *
 * you can be sure that "MyStyle" will always return the same instance, which is probably what people expect when they
 * see the above declaration anyway!
 *
 * This is especially important in the world of Compose, where otherwise, every time you passed a property declared
 * using this "by" syntax, you'd end up getting a new value each time, which would cause a recomposition each time!
