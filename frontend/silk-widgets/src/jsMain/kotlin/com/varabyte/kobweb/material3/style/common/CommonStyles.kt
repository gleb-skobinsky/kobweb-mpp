// Note: CSS provides a `disabled` selector, but disabling elements using HTML properties prevents mouse events from
// firing, and this is bad because you might want to show tooltips even for a disabled element. Some solutions online
// solve this by wrapping disabled elements in a parent element, but this can screw up things like flexbox rows and
// columns, which act on their direct children and *not* children of children (e.g. missing a `flex-grow` setting on
// an element just because you wrapped it with a tooltip).
// Instead, we just imitate disabled behavior ourselves in silk.

/**
 * A style which opts an element into background color transitions, which looks better than color snapping when the
 * color mode changes.
 *
 * This is recommended to be used with your app's root `Surface`:
 *
 * ```
 * Surface(SmoothColorStyle.toModifier()) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * but you may need to additionally apply it on children which themselves modify their own background colors in response
 * to color mode changes, since in CSS, transitions are not inherited.
 *
 * Pro-tip: If you are defining your own ComponentStyle that updates the background color and want it to also apply
 * smooth styles, you can use this `extraModifier` pattern:
 *
 * ```
 * val ExampleStyle = CssStyle(extraModifier = { SmoothColorStyle.toModifier() }) {
 *    ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note: This is shared as a style instead of a simple modifier so that a user can tweak the timing in their own site by
 * overriding the style if they'd like.
